# Notes

## Todos

- [ ] keep allowing of sharing a variants across unions - why? why not?

  - e.g. share None across all typed Optionals e.g. Optional<Hash>, Optional<Array>, etc.
  - downside is that variant is not unique for a union type

- use two types of variants - tagged (with union) and untagged - why? why not?
