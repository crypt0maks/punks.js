### What about Safe Enumeration (Integer) Types?

Yes, yes, yes. The `Enum` class from the enums library gets auto-required.
Use like:

``` ruby
Enum.new( :Color, :red, :green, :blue )
## or
enum :Color, :red, :green, :blue
## or
enum :Color, [:red, :green, :blue]
```

See the [enums library documentation for more Â»](https://github.com/s6ruby/enums)
